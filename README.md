## Problem Statement
Context: 
Due to the work structure, there is a high burnout rate faced by junior doctors in Singapore's Healthcare Industries. For junior doctors, they are normally in charge of six to 10 patients during a shift. However, they are on call, which means that these can go up to three wards, or even 100 patient! This results in a heavy workload, and subsequently long working hours experienced by the junior doctors. With long working hours, they will lack sufficient rest, add that together with demands from patients and their relatives, the fear of making mistakes due to their inexperience, and it will result in a recipe for disaster. Such factors will also contribute huge stress to junior doctors, which will not be good for them in a long term. Thus, as their main stress factor is their fear of making mistakes, our goal is to help them relieve some of this stress.




## About MediScan
Our solution is to develop an AI/ML model that can help to automate medical diagnosis process of illnesses such as COVID-19. Our model utilizes the Data-Efficient Image Transformer (DeiT) technique, a type of Vision Transformer for image classification tasks, it will be able to analyze and identify patterns in xray images that can potentially aid in the detecting illnesses. 

Healthcare workers will input a patient's xray image and our model will return a diagnosis of an illness. In our use case, the output will be either COVID positive or negative.
