## Problem Statement
Context: 
Due to the work structure, high burnout rate faced by Singapore's healthcare industry. For junior doctors, the heavy workload, long working hours as they might be in charge of six to 10 patients during a normal shift, this can go up to three wards, or 100 patients, when on call.
Due lack of sufficient rest, demands from patients and relatives, and fear of making mistakes,
such factors will contribute huge stress to the junior doctors, hence it will not be good in a long term.
Main stressing factor is due to fear of making mistakes, as it is health related, thus we want to help them in this area.
